However, the binarization inevitably causes severe information loss, and even worse, its discontinuity brings difficulty to the optimization of the deep network. To address these issues, a variety of algorithms have been proposed, and achieved satisfying progress in recent years. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these algorithms, mainly categorized into the native solutions directly conducting binarization, and the optimized ones using techniques like minimizing the quantization error, improving the network loss function, and reducing the gradient error. We also investigate other practical aspects of binary neural networks such as the hardware-friendly design and the training tricks. Then, we give the evaluation and discussions on different tasks, including image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. Finally, the challenges that may be faced in future research are prospected.","tags":["Binary neural network","Deep learning","Model compression","Network quantization","Model acceleration"],"title":"Binary neural networks: A survey","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuhang Li","Wei Wang","Haoli Bai","Ruihao Gong","Xin Dong","Fengwei Yu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648366062,"objectID":"32738930d483fa6f4e26a6a2115188b4","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/2020-arxiv-ebs/","publishdate":"2022-03-27T07:28:59.476187Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-arxiv-ebs/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Efficient Bitwidth Search for Practical Mixed Precision Neural Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qingchang Han","Yongmin Hu","Fengwei Yu","Hailong Yang","Bing Liu","Peng Hu","Ruihao Gong","Yanfei Wang","Rui Wang","Zhongzhi Luan","Depei Qian"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648366064,"objectID":"5b58a06350e087633976687b4a9bdca9","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/2020-icpp-lowbit/","publishdate":"2022-03-27T07:29:00.583344Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-icpp-lowbit/","section":"publication","summary":"With the continuous demand for higher accuracy of deep neural networks, the model size has increased significantly. Quantization is one of the most widely used model compression methods, which can effectively reduce the model size without severe accuracy loss. Modern processors such as ARM CPU and NVIDIA GPU have already provided the support of low-bit arithmetic instructions. However, there lack efficient and practical optimizations for convolution computation towards extremely low-bit on ARM CPU (e.g., 2 ‚àº 8-bit) and NVIDIA GPU (e.g., 4-bit and 8-bit). This paper explores the performance optimization methods of extremely low-bit convolution on diverse architectures. On ARM CPU, we propose two instruction schemes for 2 ‚àº 3-bit and 4 ‚àº 8-bit convolution with corresponding register allocation methods. In addition, we re-design the GEMM computation with data padding and packing optimizations. We also implement winograd algorithm for convolution with some specific bit width (e.g., 4 ‚àº 6-bit) to achieve higher performance. On NVIDIA GPU, we propose a data partition mechanism and multi-level memory access optimizations, to better adapt the computation to GPU thread and memory hierarchy. We also propose quantization fusion to eliminate unnecessary data access. The experiment results demonstrate our implementations achieve better performance of extremely low-bit convolution compared to the state-of-the-art frameworks and libraries such as ncnn and cuDNN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides efficient implementations of extremely low-bit convolutions covering 2 ‚àº 8-bit on ARM CPU and 4-bit/8-bit on NVIDIA GPU.
